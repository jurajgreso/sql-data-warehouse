# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository!
With this project I am demonstrating a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights.
This project highlights the best practices in data engineering and analytics that I learned from Baraa Khatib Salkini, the Lead Data Engineering, Analytics & AI @Mercedes-Benz AG and YouTube Educator "DataWithBaraa".

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
